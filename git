===================Git===================
#Every commit is immutable. It never changes
    only ever adding
      so, how to delete?
        add a deletion
      when you change the past, you're fucking up everyone who has the present
#your repository is an aggregation of all your commits...all your additions and deletions
#A branch is a named commit

#CARDINAL RULES
#Commit constantly
#run git status after everything you do

#Practice
